MobileApps2013Demos
===================

A collection of mobile (web) apps developed during my [Mobile Applications Development](http://lore.com/MAD2013) course in 2013 at the University of L'Aquila.

All the lectures of the course are available [here](http://www.slideshare.net/iivanoo/presentations).

The focus of the course is on understanding the mobile applications development problem space, how to effectively design a business-ready mobile app, and how to correctly implement it.

The course is intended to cover the following topics:

+ Understanding of the mobile ecosystem, platforms and strategies
+ Mobile information architecture and UI Design
+ Mobile app distribution and monetization
+ Web technologies for mobile app development (HTML5, CSS3, JQuery, and other frameworks)
+ Data management (local data storage, REST APIs, server-side data storage)
+ Geolocalization and mapping
+ Accessing the device capabilities (camera, accelerometer, contacts, messaging, etc.)
+ Security and user authentication
+ Mobile app Debugging

In the following I report a small description of each demo I developed and made available to the participants of the course. All the demos are listed in the same order as I introduced them throughout the course, each demo is available as a distinct folder in this repository.
